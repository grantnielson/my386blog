This is a collection of code used to make my personal blog, "Moneyball Moments." I love the movie and concept of Moneyball (using stats to acheive better outcomes in sports or business), so you'll see that my blog is mainly about sports. 

I'm most proud of the data vizualisations I came up with, both the content and execution of what I found to be somewhat difficult features (graph annotations, recoloring and resizing points in scatterplots, etc). 

Here's the link to the blog https://grantnielson.github.io/my386blog/

The meat and potatoes for the python scripts used are actually found in this repo https://github.com/grantnielson/blog-3-real.
