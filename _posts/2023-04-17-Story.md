The recent March Madness college basketball tournament (one of the best in years, by the way) inspired me to take a closer look at the characteristics of successful college hoops teams. If you've been following along, you have already seen the journey from web scraping code all the way to colorful graphs. If you haven't been in the loop, here's a quick review + one last visual to finalize my review of the 2021 college men's basketball season.

# The Steps

A basic element of each step is pictured:

### Scrape

### Clean

### Start making Plots

### Double Down on Graph Quality

# Final Graphic

There is always criticism that the [tournament is a bad way to show the top teams](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/the-ncaa-tournament-is-the-worst-way-to-crown-a-champ) and crown a champion. While I usually agree with that statement, 2021 seems like it actually held up pretty well:

The highest statistically ranked teams (thanks Basketball References for creating the SRS metric) seemed to be the top performers! Gonzaga was the highest ranked and they came in 2nd, then Baylor (Champs) and Houston (final four team) were the next in line. This was fairly easy to deduce; the real power of this graph comes in seeing how the non top teams did. You can choose to read the graph from top right to bottom left to see SRS and winning %, or you can jsut read it from the top down to only see SRS. Either way, you'll see that the color scale on the legend generally matches how the teams sorted out on the graph (with exceptions of course, but we're just looking for general trends). This means the teams that were expected to do well, did well! 

<small>(It's important to note that SRS and winning % included regular & postseason games. So yes, if a team had a crazy run in the tournament their ranking and record would go up, but those metrics would still be most heavily influenced by their regular season performance. If it was just post season that affected the metrics, it would be a self-serving graph that didn't tell us much.)</small>


Let me know if the comments if you agree, and thanks for following along!
