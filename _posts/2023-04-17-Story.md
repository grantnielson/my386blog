The recent March Madness college basketball tournament (one of the best in years, by the way) inspired me to take a closer look at the characteristics of successful college hoops teams. If you've been following along, you have already seen the journey from web scraping code all the way to colorful graphs. If you haven't been in the loop, here's a quick review + one last visual to finalize my review of the 2021 college men's basketball season.
