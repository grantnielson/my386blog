If you are grading this, please come back in like a day because I will have it done then (I used my late days for this).



One of my initial curiosities was the relationship between assists and making the tournament. I decided that using an assit/game metric would be better than total season assists, so I plotted average ast/game for tournament vs non-tourney teams.

Tournament teams seem to have more assists per game which makes sense (better teams make the tourney, more assists make a team better) but the difference is only about 1 Assist, which isn't a huge difference. I would imagine at this point that there are better predictive metrics out there.


## SOS / W-L% Scatterplot
Next, I decided to see if tournament teams could be easily identified by Win-Loss record (W-L%), strength of schedule (SOS), or both. I plotted W-L& record vs SOS and sorted the colors by whether a school was Tournament team.



# Interactive - winning v SOS

The first thing that jumps out to me is that the 3 of the final four teams Baylor (champ), Gonzaga (runner-up), and Houston were all clustered together in the top right. This is preliminary evidence that on top of winning lots of games, it's important to have a good strength of schedule. The three teams below them; Colgate, Winthrop, and Belmont, didn't play strong teams and didn't have any tournament wins. It's important to note that not all teams have the same ability to have a higher SOS - the majority of teams a given school will play come from their conference, and as a general rule, teams in the same conference are at comparable strengths. 

That leads into the next interesting observation - The top 5 hardest schedules (the ones along the top) were played by schools from only the Big 10 conference. Looking into the data, Michigan State only won 54% of their games, but since they played in the Big 10 (consequently facing a tough schedule) they received an invitation to the tournament (they end up losing in the first round). 

This begs the question: is it better for middle-of-the-pack to decent team to be in a hard conference, where they don't get a good record but face good teams, or be a team like Winthrop that wins all their games but plays poor-performing teams? It's hard to say, but I believe that if a team is good enough, they will win regardless of their conference. Evidence of this is that right now in the 2023 tournament, we are down to 4 teams, and only half come from "power conferences." This means that the two other teams, San Diego State and Florida Atlantic are in conferences where their strength of schedule isn't very high, but they are still finding success! What's funny too is that the power conference teams, UConn and Miami, have combined for 15 losses on the season. Essentially, anyone can be good!
