Moneyball Moments gets its name from the book that inspired the content of this blog and thousands of others. Authored by Michael Lewis, Moneyball tells the tale of how the 2002 Oakland Athletics baseball organization turned the sports world on its head by adopting advanced analytics that helped them acheive the longest winning streak in MLB history.

This blog pays respect to those who paved the way for sports analytics in the current day by providing rhetoric about why analytics is a game-changer in the sports world, sharing models and plots with specific insights about team performance, and engaging with readers to explain and stay up-to-date on analytic trends. 
To semi-quote Billy Beane, Moneyball's founding father, how can you not be romantic about baseball (strikethrough) sports analytics?
